GameBackerPlus - The worlds first "Simple game backer" that makes backups when you Add, Start, And Quit the game.

With it's simple GUI, you can easily add a game to its backup list and have The program make periodic backups. This program runs Totally hidden in the Background, you will never even know its there, 'Until you unfortunately loose/corrupt a save. To unhide the program, simply press (Winkey + F12) to bring back up the GUI. There is also a "Full-Time Protection" feature that allows you to have the program boot on startup.

And now, GameBackerPlus is completely free and open source!

## Getting Started

When getting started using GameBackerPlus, It's recommended to turn on the "Full-Time Protection" feature located on the main GUI. What this does is allows the Program to start back up (Hidden in the background) automatically each time the user signs back in, or reboots there PC. It's also important to note, that when attempting to minimize the program, click CLOSE, not the red "X", that will terminate the program thus, it will not make backups of your games.

**Backup location:**  By default, When you first open GameBackerPlus, it creates a new directory in the C:\ drive. This can be changed to any location you wish or be kept the same.

**Adding a game:**  When adding a game, be sure the desired game is first running. This ensures that it will show up in the "process" list. Next you will want to select a "Game folder location", thus, being the folder you wish to backup. Weather that be the entire game save location, or just a character/world. Click ok and you're set togo.

**Restoring a game:**  The restore option on the main GUI allows you to restore a game- backup that you may have unfortunately lost, or had corrupt. Simply click on a backup, click recover, and select a output-directory. Magic.

**Auto deleting backups:**  GameBackerPlus by default, deletes old save files after seven days. Within the "restore" tab, this can either be disabled or extended up to six months (182 days).
